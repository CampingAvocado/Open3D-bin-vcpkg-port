Open3D-bin provides CMake targets:

find_package(Open3D REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(My_Project PRIVATE Open3D::Open3D)

# On Windows if BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is enabled, copy .dll files to the executable directory
if(WIN32)
    get_target_property(open3d_type Open3D::Open3D TYPE)
    if(open3d_type STREQUAL "SHARED_LIBRARY")
        message(STATUS "Copying Open3D.dll to ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/$<CONFIG>")
        add_custom_command(TARGET Draw POST_BUILD
                           COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy
                                   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/Open3D.dll
                                   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/$<CONFIG>)
    endif()
endif()
